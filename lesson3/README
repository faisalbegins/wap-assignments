Things I have learned from this exercise are,
	1. Before understanding CSS layout it is important to understand CSS box model
	2. Only way to manage CSS layout is by using float.
	3. Flots are very difficult to visualize
	4. Only using float is not going to help, we also need to use Clear in Conjunction with Float
	5. Divs only expand for non floats elements.
